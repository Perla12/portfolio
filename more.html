    <h1>No 1</h1>
    <p>The good friend</p>
  <pre>
      As you walk through the paths of life
      you realize that sometimes 
      even when you feel matured
      you need a helping hand

      Your efforts gets tied to a limit
      and someone special person
      gets the power tountie those limits
      with an authority from abve the skies
      
      A true friend is your other you
      Ready to function when the real you is weak
      when tied to the world's chugging
      mon bonne amie

      Is there to fight the inevitable
      even when you are dead to the world
      they are there to remind you
      how special you are

      Mon bonne amie 
      dosen't care if the world laughs at us
      "what matters is we smile for each other"
      she alwalys says

      Mon bonne amie
      wants me to rule the world having her
      and would never take a stop 
      even when the world convicts me wrongly
